        <h1>Little Boy</h1>
        <p>Little Boy was the codename for the first atomic Bomb. It was a gun-type fission bomb that based its explosive power off the nuclear fission of Uranium 235. It was developed at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance Division. The bombs components were actually split up so that different parts were built at three different factories so that no one actually had the full design. The bomb contained 64 kilograms of enriched Uranium, but less than a kilogram of Uranium actually underwent the process of fission. Fission was achieved by igniting a small explosion inside the bomb, shooting a cylinder of Uranium into another cylinder of Uranium from opposite lengths of the bomb. While enroute to Hiroshima, the bomb initially was disarmed due to fears that the bomb would accidentally explode if the plane crash. To prevent this from happening, the bomb was not armed until the plane was safely in the air. On August 16, 1945, Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima.</p>

        <h1>Fat Man</h1>
        <p>Fat Man was the codename for the second Atomic bomb that was used in WWII. It was an implosion type bomb that had a plutonium core. An earlier version of a plutonium atomic bomb was The Gadget which was used during the Trinity Test in New Mexico. Also, two Fat Man bombs were tested in Bikini Atoll.</p>

        <h1>Enola Gay</h1>
        <p>The Enola Gay was the name given to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bomber that dropped the Atomic Bomb (Little Boy) on Hiroshima. During this mission, it was piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets. The Enola Gay was built by the Lockheed Martin Company at a Bellevue, Nebraska plant. The plane was personally picked out by Colonel Tibbets for the mission while it was still on the assembly line. The plane was then flown to Guam to receive bomb bay modifications to properly contain Little Boy. During preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets decided to name the bomber after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets.  Before piloting the atomic bomb to its target, the plane first flew eight training flights and two missions, dropping pumpkin bombs on targets in Kobe and Nagoya. On the day of the bombing, the bomb was stored in the bomb bay of the bomber. After the successful bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay was used for weather reconnaissance over Kokura (the primary location for the dropping of the second atomic bomb). The plane reported clear skies, but the town was covered in smoke which prevented the second atomic bomb (Fat Man) from being dropped there. Instead, Fatman was dropped on Nagasaki.</p>
