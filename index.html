        <h1>Little Boy</h1>
        <p>Little Boy was the codename for the first atomic Bomb used in WWII. It was a gun-type fission bomb that based its explosive power off the nuclear fission of Uranium 235. It was developed at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance Division. The bombs components were actually split up so that different parts were built at three different factories so that no one actually had the full design. The bomb contained 64 kilograms of enriched Uranium, but less than a kilogram of Uranium actually underwent the process of fission. Fission was achieved by igniting a small explosion inside the bomb, shooting a cylinder of Uranium into another cylinder of Uranium from opposite lengths of the bomb. While enroute to Hiroshima, the bomb initially was disarmed due to fears that the bomb would accidentally explode if the plane crash. To prevent this from happening, the bomb was not armed until the plane was safely in the air. On August 16, 1945, Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima.</p>

    <div id="infoFatMan" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Fat Man</h1>
        <p>Fat Man was the codename for the second Atomic bomb that was used in WWII. It was an implosion type bomb that had a plutonium core. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb. However, more effort was put into the development of the gun-type fission bomb because it had the least amount of uncertainty equated to it. An earlier version of Fat Man was The Gadget which was used during the Trinity Test in New Mexico. Along with testing in New Mexico, two plutonium bombs were tested in Bikini Atoll. Fat Man proved to be the more devastating of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan.</p>

    <div id="infoEnolaGay" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Enola Gay</h1>
        <p>The Enola Gay was the name given to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bomber that dropped the Atomic Bomb (Little Boy) on Hiroshima. During this mission, it was piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets. The Enola Gay was built by the Lockheed Martin Company at a Bellevue, Nebraska plant. The aircraft was personally picked out by Colonel Tibbets for the mission while it was still on the assembly line. The aircraft was then flown to Guam to receive bomb bay modifications to properly contain Little Boy. During preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets decided to name the bomber after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets.  Before piloting the atomic bomb to its target, the plane first flew eight training flights and two missions, dropping pumpkin bombs on targets in Kobe and Nagoya. On the day of the bombing, the bomb was stored in the bomb bay of the bomber. After the successful bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay was used for weather reconnaissance over Kokura (the primary location for the dropping of the second atomic bomb). The plane reported clear skies, but the town was covered in smoke which prevented the second atomic bomb (Fat Man) from being dropped there. Instead, Fatman was dropped on Nagasaki.</p>

    <div id="infoBattleOfMidway" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Battle of Midway</h1>
        <p>One of Japan’s major goals was to remove the US as a strategic power in the Pacific so that they could be free to extend their influence into East Asia. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japan thought that another strong military victory would force the US to give up in the Pacific. The Japanese also wanted Midway so they could extend their early warning system on US air raids. The Japanese set into a place a plan to destroy American carriers by luring them into a trap. However, the plan failed for many reasons. Like many Japanese naval strategies, the plan was complicated and relied on optimistic information about damage done to US vessels on previous attacks. However, the most important part was that American code breakers cracked a transmission containing the date and plans for attack.</p>
	<p>Early on June 4th Japan attacked the midway base and severely damaged it. However, the US Navy was just to the east of the island. When the first wave of attack was finished and the Japanese aircraft were refueling, the US attacked with both Naval and base forces and over a two day period drove off the Japanese heavily damaging them with minimal casualties. This was an important victory because midway was the perfect launch point for various air raids and a base to refuel and recoup at.</p></div>
    <div id="infoIwoJima" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Iwo Jima</h1>
        <p>On February 19th, 1945 American forces attacked the island of Iwo Jima in order to take over the air strips that were there. The air strips at Iwo Jima were the perfect place to have pilots refuel and rest before going on more bombing runs. After the landing started, the US military came up against the 22,000 Japanese soldiers encamped there. The Japanese army had already dug in and were hard to fight against. It took the Marines until March 26, 1945 to fully take over the island and only about 1,000 of the Japanese soldiers could be taken alive. The US casualties were very heavy which made the island a controversial target especially because it was the only time American casualties outnumbered Japaneses casualties. There were 24,000 Americans injured or killed versus that of the 21,000 Japanese. In the end the Americans were victorious and the photograph Raising of the US Flag immortalized the battle.</p>

    <div id="infoLeyte" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Leyte</h1>
        <p>On the 17th of October an amphibious invasion of Leyte started. The main offensive was American Marines however, Filipino guerilla forces took up arms and aided the US in resecuring Leyte. This was the first battle in the Philippines campaign of 1944-45. The Japanese fought back by air and sea however the land campaign reduced their air ability by over 50% forcing them to rely on kamikaze pilots. This is the first battle in which the Japanese used this type of warfare. Off shore the largest naval battle in the history of warfare was taking place. This battle destroyed the Japanese Navy and made it no longer capable of being an effective force. In the failed defense of Leyte the Japanese lost over 65,000 troops.</p>

    <div id="infoManhattan" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Manhattan</h1>
        <p>The Manhattan project was the code name for the US Military’s research that produced the first atomic bombs.  Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers directed the operation. The project  came about as a response to the knowledge that the Axis had found the secret to splitting the atom and the fear that they could possibly use it to create a bomb that would have great destructive ability. The project started off slow with out much funding, however in 1942 Fermi commanded attention from the government by setting off a controlled nuclear chain reaction. After the reaction the program had little issue acquiring funding with around 2 billion dollars spent on the project mostly in the set up and enrichment process of uranium. On July 16, 1945, at Trinity Site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, the first nuclear weapon was tested and with a blinding flash the world entered the Nuclear Age. The Manhattan Project continued to be the main source of US nuclear power until the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947. It also was directly involved with the bomb dropping on hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

    <div id="infoOkinawa" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Okinawa</h1>
        <p>The battle of Okinawa was the biggest and bloodiest battle in the pacific campaign. The battle itself lasted for 82 days straight, from early april until mid june, and had the most amphibious vehicles. The Island was only 340 miles of the main island of Japan and the allies intended to use it as a base of operations for the Air Force. They also planned to launch an invasion of the main land from Okinawa. The code name of this invasion was going to be Operation Downfall. The Japanese needed to hold this island to prevent easy invasions from the allies. This led to furious fighting that brought about the name the typhoon of steel. This name refers to all the ships, vehicles, and planes that bombarded both sides of the conflict.</p>
        <p>The Americans Landed on the first of April with an all out amphibious assault.Four divisions of the US Army, the 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th, and two Marine divisions, the 1st and the 6th, landed on the shores while being supported from sea and air. The Japanese tactics were obviously mostly defensive and had 67,000-77,000 soldiers consisting of citizens who had been drafted and students in the hospitals. The battle had so many casualties that a monument was erected in honour of those who died in okinawa during world war 2. The monument currently has 240,931 names.</p></div>
    <div id="infoPearlHarbor" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Pearl Harbor</h1>
        <p>December 7th, 1941 was a major day in the US involvement in the war. In one day the Japanese removed the US battleship force as a threat to Japanese expansion into the Pacific but also unified the American people in a way that has never been seen since. Within a short time most of the battleships at Pearl Harbor were sunk or sinking, and the rest of them were damaged. Other ships along with ground-based aircraft were destroyed as well. Directly there after, Japan eliminated most of the American forces in the Philippines, and Malaya. This sudden turn of events caught America unaware and was seen as a sneak attack. The strike had greatly changed America’s outlook on the war. Before the strike on Pearl Harbor the American people were torn, but after the attack they were firmly united in entering the war.</p>

    <div id="infoSaipan" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Saipan</h1>
        <p>On June 15, 1944, American forces, on part of the Mariana Island campaign, invaded the island of Saipan. Saipan was of major strategic importance for the US because it had huge air fields and put the Japan within range from the US bombers. Because of this, the Japanese fervently wanted to hold onto this island. There was a two day long battle of the coast of Saipan which became one of the biggest carrier battles of world war two. Japan suffered the loss of three carriers and over 300 planes and incredible loss of life on land; almost all of their 30,000 troops. However, the worst part was the loss of civilian life. As the Marines started to take over towns, civilians who were terrified of the US soldiers began to commit mass suicide. This act changed Japan’s national policy towards one of death before surrender which led them to be more stubborn when it became clear they would lose the war.</p>

    <div id="infoBattleOfMindoro" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Mindoro</h1>
        <p>The battle of Mindoro was a battle fought during the Philippine campaign and was a strategic battle to gain position to attack Luzon. The island of Mindoro did not have a large Japanese fighting force and the US was receiving military support from the filipino guerilla force that had been resisting Japan control. with the established air base in Mindoro, the US could more easily launch aerial and amphibious attacks on their final target Luzon. The Island was quickly taken over after just a three day battle.</p>
        <p>On December 15th US forces landed on the shore of San Jose on the south west side of the island. There was very clear weather that day and this allowed for a lot of aerial and naval support including six escort carriers, three battleships, six cruisers and many other small ships. these forces met up against 1,500 Japanese defenders 200 of which were there because of their ship sinking en route to Leyte. The battle was over very quickly and within 48 hours the island was secure and 72 until it was quiet of all enemy activity. by the end of the first day, however, engineers were setting up the airfields that would become the launching point against Luzon.</p></div>
    <div id="infoBattleOfLuzon" class="infoPage">
        <h1>Luzon</h1>
        <p>The Philippines where a great strategic area in the Pacific war because their capture allowed the Japanese to have a closer base to the US. The threat this caused showed that the US needed to take back the Philippines. The Battle of Luzon was the last main battle in the Philippines that led to American dominance. The assault was launched on January 9th with over 70 ships entering the Lingayen Gulf and beginning pre strike bombardment. Through out the next few weeks bombardment and and battles continued throughout the island. By early March American and Filipino forces had taken over all the strategically and economically important areas. Many of the Japanese defenders fled to the mountains and held out there till the unconditional surrender from Japan.</p>
